The following CSS code snippet demonstrates an uncommon error related to the specificity of CSS selectors.  The intended behavior is for the `#special` element to have a blue background, but the specificity rules conflict with the class selector `.blue` and the universal selector `*`. 

```css
* { background-color: red; }
.blue { background-color: green; }
#special { background-color: blue; }
```
